# python-socketio-template
This is an interactive game template by using the fastapi-socket package:

(1) Create a POST request to /room/create_room to obtain a room_id.

(2) Input the room_id on the host page and join the room.

(3) Input the room_id on the guest page and join the room.

(4) The host or guest can exit at any time, which will remove their session from the room.

(5) When the guest presses "ready," it informs the host that the guest is ready.

(6) When the host presses "play," the game begins.
